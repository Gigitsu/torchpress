Deep Learning with Torch: Aproaches
==========================

Now it is a month that I'm playing with Torch and Lua to define Deep Learning algorithms and I want to share my feelings and suggestions on it.

### Introduction

As first step I started from [char-rnn project](). I didn't know lua nor torch and it was wery hard to understand what was in the code. After, I spent the first 2 weeks revriting the code and doing experiments to get used to the language.
